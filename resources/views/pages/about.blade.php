                        1st class

                        vast fertile land bordering the two bodies of water now known as Batangas Bay and Balayan Bay

                        Calumpan Peninsula.</p>

                        founded until even the upland regions of the peninsula were settled. The inhabitants had their
                        own form of village government.</p>
