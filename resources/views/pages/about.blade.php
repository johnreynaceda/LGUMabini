                        1st class
                        municipality in the province of Batangas, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a

                        vast fertile land bordering the two bodies of water now known as Batangas Bay and Balayan Bay

                        Calumpan Peninsula.</p>

                        appropriate and the sea rich in marine resources, and they established their settlement in this
                        once vast unknown land. As more Malay settlers arrived from distant lands, more settlements were
                        founded until even the upland regions of the peninsula were settled. The inhabitants had their
                        own form of village government.</p>
